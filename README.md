Introduction
The commercial space industry is booming, led by companies like SpaceX, Blue Origin, and Virgin Galactic.
SpaceX's Competitive Edge: Reusable rockets significantly reduce launch costs (Falcon 9 launch: $62M vs. $165M+ for competitors).
The key to cost reduction: Successful landing and reuse of the first stage.
Project Context: As a data scientist for Space Y, a fictional competitor to SpaceX, your mission is to:
Predict whether the first stage will successfully land.
Estimate launch costs based on mission parameters.
Build dashboards and visualizations for insights and decision-making.
This project uses SpaceXâ€™s public data and machine learning to drive innovation and cost efficiency for Space Y.
